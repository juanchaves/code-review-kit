  Run this project's pre-PR quality gate (pytest, ruff, pyrefly, code review)
  and then create a pull request with a structured summary. Use when the user
  says "create a PR", "open a PR", "submit for review", or "I'm done with this
  feature".

# Pull Request

Role: orchestrator. This command enforces quality gates before creating a PR.

You have been invoked with the `/pr` command.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. Run the quality gate and open the PR; do not bypass failing gates.
2. Delegate review to the review agents; do not review code yourself.
3. **Be concise.** Report gate results and the PR URL, no preamble.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- `--skip-review`: Skip the `/code-review` step (not recommended)
- `--draft`: Create a draft PR
- `--base <branch>`: Target branch (default: `main`)
- `--no-auto-merge`: Do not enable auto-merge (the default is to enable it; see Step 5)

## Steps

### 1. Pre-flight checks

Verify:

- Current branch is not `main` or `master`
- There are commits ahead of the base branch
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes) — if dirty, ask whether to commit or stash

### 2. Run quality gate

Run each check sequentially. Stop on first failure:

1. **Tests**: `uv run pytest -q tests`
2. **Type check**: `uvx pyrefly check`
3. **Lint**: `uvx ruff check` and `uvx ruff format --check`
4. **Security** (optional but recommended for this project): `uvx bandit -r src -ll`
5. **Code review** (unless `--skip-review`):
   - Run `/code-review --json`. `/pr` owns the human gate, so code-review runs non-interactively: it skips its own "fix or report?" prompt and applies its fix loop automatically (up to 5 iterations), then returns an aggregated status.
   - Read the returned status field. A normal review returns `{"overall": "pass|warn|fail", ...}`; a documentation-only changeset short-circuits with `{"status": "skipped", ...}`:
     - `overall` of `pass` / `warn`, or `status` of `skipped` → continue to step 3.
     - `overall` of `fail` → show the remaining findings and ask the user whether to proceed anyway or stop and fix.

Report results as a checklist:

```
## Quality Gate
- [x] Tests pass (N passed, 0 failed)
- [x] Type check clean (pyrefly)
- [x] Lint clean (ruff check, ruff format --check)
- [ ] Code review: 2 warnings (see below)
```

### 3. Generate PR summary

Analyze the diff against the base branch (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) and commit history to generate:

- **Title**: Short, imperative (<70 chars)
- **Summary**: 1-3 bullet points of what changed and why
- **Test plan**: How to verify the changes

### 4. Create the PR

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" [--draft] --base <base>
```

Use the structured template:

```markdown
## Summary
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## Quality Gate
- [x] Tests: <N> passed
- [x] Type check: clean
- [x] Lint: clean
- [x] Code review: <status>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification step 1>
- [ ] <verification step 2>
```

### 5. Enable auto-merge (default)

Unless `--no-auto-merge` or `--draft` was given, enable auto-merge so the PR lands automatically once checks pass and any required reviews are in.

```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

If the repository does not have auto-merge enabled (the command errors), report that and leave the PR open for manual merge — do **not** merge directly to trunk to work around it.

### 6. Report

Display the PR URL and a summary of the quality gate results.

If any gate failed and the user chose to proceed anyway, note this in the PR body as a caveat.
